		<h1>My Learning Style</h1>

			<li>Tactile: 20%</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hired, trained and mentored 6 employees that helped increase productivity by 20% for resort night staff.</li>
			<li>Added 4 new lines of service per month for 12 months for a mobile carrier.</li>
			<li>Designed and sewed 8 skirts for a flamenco dance group.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Qualitative Accomplishments:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Attention to details has helped me receive a promotion at a cleaning position. After learning all the expectations, I was thorough in not only cleaning tasks, but logging the tasks and creating plans to finish larger job. This quality proved to also be a weakness because the staff felt like I was asking too much of them.</li>
			<li>Leadership was the skill my boss seen in me that helped him decide to promote me. The project lists and timelines I created and shared with the team and received their buy in was my leadership in action. This skill was a weakness in a conversation with my boss. He was proposing a schedule that I did not agree with for the team. I took it upon my self to speak for them as their "leader" without actually presenting them with the schedule and receiving feedback.</li>
			<li>Adaptablity helped me adhere to the new schedule. I was able to adjust my timelines for daily duties and for the long term projects. This became a weakness because I was adapting more than myself or my crew could handle.</li>
		</ul>
